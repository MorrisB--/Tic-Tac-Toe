To Do (Alpha):

* Prompt user to enter another location if their current location is full

BUGS FOUND

* If user tries to block the computer will overwrite their move and  force a win.
  I believe this is happening because winNow() does not check to see if the cell
  it's playing is empty. For example if [0][1] and [0][2] are equal to 'O'. It
  will play 'O' in [0][0], whether the user blocked or not.
  
  Test Case:
  Userplays 8, then 2, then 3
  
  
To Do (Beta):
