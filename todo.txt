To Do (Alpha):

* Prompt user to enter another location if their chosen location is full

BUGS FOUND

* If user tries to block the computer will overwrite their move and  force a win.
  I believe this is happening because winNow() does not check to see if the cell
  it's playing is empty. For example if [0][1] and [0][2] are equal to 'O'. It
  will play 'O' in [0][0], whether the user blocked or not.
  
  Test Case:
  Userplays 8, then 2, then 3

* There are particular cases where the computer does not play and/or the computer plays on the winning move.
  When I debugged it yesterday, it seems like there is an issue with the bestWins() method. It looks like the 
  criteria for it to make a selection is not being met so it does not play any move. 

  Test Case: 
  Userplays 0, then 8 (after this move is where I noticed the computer did not play)
  Userplays 6 then 3 (after the winning move, the computer also played) 
  
To Do (Beta):
// Start once Alpha is completed

1) Clean up if statements in all Gameboard methods
2) Take out unneeded comments
3) Add comments to help users understand what is going on


BACKLOG:

* Add proper description for this repo
* Ask user to play again
